- [Cinematics Prototype](https://mbermanucsc.github.io/finalPrototypes/cinematics/)    
- [Scene Flow Prototype](https://mbermanucsc.github.io/finalPrototypes/sceneFlow/)   
- [Core Gameplay Prototype](https://mbermanucsc.github.io/finalPrototypes/coreGameplay/)     
- Our project relates to the theme "nearby in space but distant in time" because the main character Kayce is trapped in this liminal void taking place within half a second giving Kayce a chance to reflect on Monica's death.  
- 3 Selectable Requirements: Data-driven experience progression, Procedural audio, and Complete Closed Captioning  
- Miles Berman and Jackson Nadler-Block were Technology Leads  
- Nicholas Schetman was our Production Lead  
- Finn DePuy was our Testing Lead  
- All audio assets created by Miles Berman. All narrative and visual assets were created by Nicholas Schetman.  
  **Source Code**   
- Everyone contributed to the code. Jackson Nadler-Block committed more because our team often worked together via Live Shares hosted by Jackson Nadler-Block.  



# Selectable Requirements:  
- Data Driven Experience Progression: the game is created using map.json to create all the different rooms and the interactable objects inside them. (Note items are randomly spawned into rooms using a different format)  
- Procedural Audio: We planned on using procedural audio until the last minute when we decided to go with different background music instead. Procedural audio we created is available [here](https://github.com/mbermanUCSC/finalMusicDemo)  
- Complete Closed Captioning: When the player starts the game, they get to pick whether they are playing on desktop or mobile. There is an option on this screen to enable closed captioning. Closed captioning displaying on the top left of the screen, showcasing which music and sound effects are currently playing.
