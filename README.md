# Core Requirements:   

  **Project Archive**   
- [The Report](https://finndepuy.github.io/The-Report/)    
- [Cinematics Prototype](https://mbermanucsc.github.io/finalPrototypes/cinematics/)    
- [Scene Flow Prototype](https://mbermanucsc.github.io/finalPrototypes/sceneFlow/)   
- [Core Gameplay Prototype](https://mbermanucsc.github.io/finalPrototypes/coreGameplay/)     
- Our project relates to the theme "nearby in space but distant in time" because the main character Kayce is trapped in this liminal void taking place within half a second giving Kayce a chance to reflect on Monica's death.  
- 3 Selectable Requirements: Data-driven experience progression, Procedural audio, and Complete Closed Captioning  
- Miles Berman and Jackson Nadler-Block were Technology Leads  
- Nicholas Schetman was our Production Lead  
- Finn DePuy was our Testing Lead  
- All audio assets created by Miles Berman. All narrative and visual assets were created by Nicholas Schetman.  
  **Source Code**   
- Everyone contributed to the code. Jackson Nadler-Block had more commits because our team often worked together via Live Shares hosted by Jackson Nadler-Block.  
**Mobile**  
- When the player starts the game, they can select either a computer or phone icon to choose the game version they want to play. The touch control (mobile) version also allows for keyboard input, but the computer version doesn't have touch controls.  
- The game includes a fullscreen button that can be toggled at anytime, which has support on Android and Desktop, but does not work on IOS.  
- The game loads relatively quick and also has a loading screen so that even if it takes a few seconds, the player won't think it's broken. The animations are also smooth.  
**Self-Teaching**  
-  The game starts off with a tutorial that forces the player to interact with the main game mechanics before continuing.  
**Persistent Music Toggle**  
- The game includes an option to toggle whether or not background music is playing which persists even if the page is reloaded. Sound effects can still be heard while the music is turned off.  
**Completability**  
- Core gameplay can be reached within a few seconds as the tutorial forces the player to pick up an item, and hide from Monica who is chasing you.  
- Experienced players can finish the game within 10 minutes on their first playthrough as long as they don't get caught by Monica (this causes a 'game over').  
- Even if the players want to collect all 12 narrative items, they can finish within 10 minutes, but the players can also finish earlier by filling out the questions at the desk as soon as they have unlocked 1/3 options. 



# Selectable Requirements:  
- Data Driven Experience Progression: the game is created using map.json to create all the different rooms and the interactable objects inside them. (Note items are randomly spawned into rooms using a different format)  
- Procedural Audio: We planned on using procedural audio until the last minute when we decided to go with different background music instead. Procedural audio we created is available [here](https://github.com/mbermanUCSC/finalMusicDemo)  
- Complete Closed Captioning: When the player starts the game, they get to pick whether they are playing on desktop or mobile. There is an option on this screen to enable closed captioning. Closed captioning displaying on the top left of the screen, showcasing which music and sound effects are currently playing.
